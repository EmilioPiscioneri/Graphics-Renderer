# Graphics Renderer
## Introduction
Hi, my name is Emilio Piscioneri and this is my graphics renderer project. I tried to attempt something similar by making a game engine last year (2022) but I didn't actually take the time to understand openGL or c++ that much. I also skipped over the math but now I'm in year 11 and the math is stuff I'm actually learning and understanding, as well as the openGL stuff too. 

## Vision
As of writing this the renderer/engine is pretty small but I inted to add quite a few features and potentially get it to an almost unity like application. Of course with a lot fewer features but something that you can edit within a drag and drop like thingo that is run using the engine lmao.

## Inspiration
The structure/architecture of the actual engine itself is based on how unity does some things and the very basic stuff like the sprite renderer is based on the [learn openGL 2D game](https://learnopengl.com/In-Practice/2D-Game/Breakout). Apart from that I'm gonna try write as much code myself as I can because its a fun side project that's gonna help me both learn math, c++ and glsl.
