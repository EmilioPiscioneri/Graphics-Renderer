# Graphics Renderer
## Introduction
Hi, my name is Emilio Piscioneri and this is my graphics renderer project. I tried to attempt something similar by making a game engine last year (2022) but I didn't actually take the time to understand openGL or c++ that much. I also skipped over the math but now I'm in year 11 (2023) and the math is stuff I'm actually learning. 

## Vision
As of writing this the renderer/engine is pretty small but I inted to add quite a few features and potentially get it to an almost unity like application. Of course with a lot fewer features but something that you can edit within a drag and drop like thingo that is run using the engine lmao.

## Inspiration
Some of the structure/architecture of the actual engine itself is based on unity, the [learn openGL 2D game](https://learnopengl.com/In-Practice/2D-Game/Breakout), the roblox engine and windows .net WPF. I try to write all of the code myself, because it's a fun side project that's gonna help me both learn math, c++ and glsl. If I just copy and paste code I don't really learn much. However when it comes to certain features, I do take some inspiration from different engines (that also use different programming laguages) and then fit them into my engine.
