    * Resource manager class
    * Transform class
    * Texture2D class
    * Shader program class
    * Orthographic camera class
    * Event system
    * Entity class  

Currently the renderer is quite basic but it has a frame loop that renders entities under a scene and has a working camera. All of the added classes work properly and have a decent amount of functionality.
